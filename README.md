#AUTOSSH
## An automation for remote command execution based on SSH.

This tool should provide the ability to execute commands on a remote machine using SSH shell.
## Planned features
1. Command utility to execute a set of commands in a JSON file
2. GO library ( a wrapper on crypto/ssh) to execute a set of commands
3. Transfer a binary file to the remote machine
As of now it is tested on Ubuntu remote machines.
